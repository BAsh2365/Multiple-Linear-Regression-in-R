# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R
MLR in R using cross-validation, ridge regression, etc. Shows how the number of touchdowns for a player is affected by multiple factors. Results and graphs are shown in the respective folders with many iterations/measurements (as I documented my progress throughout the project). Updated R markdown PDFs are in a folder in this repository. My most up-to-date R Markdown file is present.
