# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R
MLR in R using train-test-split (20% visible data points (80/20)), a Ridge regression Comparison Model (With CV plot showing the minimum MSE, and degrees of freedom for a more Regularized Model), and an optimistic Supervised training model for Atlanta Falcons Data from Football Reference. Shows how the number of touchdowns for a player is affected by multiple factors. Results and graphs are shown for two models with R code examples. R Markdown PDF is also present in the repository.
